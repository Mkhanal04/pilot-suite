# Pilot Log

*Single shared log between all agents. Read at session start. Append at session end. Keep entries short.*

## 2026-03-07 — Cody

Implemented `specs/portfolio-design-fixes.md` (commit `b9a44c5`). All four fixes deployed to pilot-suite-sigma.vercel.app:
- Light mode fixed — added `mode` to `useReveal` dependency
- Section padding 120px → 96px desktop, narrow container 780px → 840px
- How I Work converted to individual chapter cards matching Story pattern
- TalentPilot tokens aligned to TradePilot (text-2, text-3, hero font sizes)

No design system conflicts. No issues.

## 2026-03-07 — StratPilot

Verified Cody's deploy independently. All four fixes confirmed on live site — light mode works, dark mode toggle preserves content, How I Work cards match Story, TalentPilot tokens match TradePilot exactly (programmatically verified). Spec marked IMPLEMENTED.

Also this session: created DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (three-tier model), design-system.html (interactive visual spec), and the portfolio-design-fixes build spec. Simplified team process — replaced CHANGELOG + feedback folder + spec status headers with this single PILOT_LOG.

**Unresolved:** `specs/portfolio-nav-flow-fixes.md` — status unknown. Was it implemented in session 2? Needs verification next session.

**Next:** Content pipeline (LinkedIn), demo flow rehearsal, portfolio-to-prototype navigation design session.

## 2026-03-07 — Cody (Session 4)

Implemented `specs/portfolio-nav-flow-fixes.md` Fix 1 (commit `ef76f49`). Work page filters are fixed — clicking any filter immediately shows cards.

**Root cause:** `filter` was missing from `useReveal`'s dependency array. When filter changed, React re-rendered new `[data-reveal]` elements but `useReveal` never re-ran to observe them — they stayed at `opacity: 0`. Adding `filter` to the dep fixes the re-run. The existing `requestAnimationFrame`-based reveal also had a race: `WorkPage` is defined inside `Portfolio`, so it remounts on every Portfolio re-render. The rAF fired before React finished committing the new elements. Replaced the two-step set-to-0-then-rAF approach with a single inline synchronous viewport check inside the `forEach` — elements in viewport get opacity:1 immediately, elements below fold get opacity:0 and are observed. Tested all three filter states (All, Products, Case Studies) — zero in-viewport-hidden elements after each switch.

**Fixes 2, 3, 4 status:** All confirmed already in code from a prior session. Fix 2 (dual CTAs on homepage): live. Fix 3 (Try it on Work cards): live. Fix 4 (Coming soon / Prototype in progress badge): live.

## 2026-03-07 — Cody (Session 5)

Implemented `specs/pilot-apps-design-consistency.md` (commit `ab43774`). All six fixes deployed to pilot-suite-sigma.vercel.app:

- **Fix 1** (HIGH): TalentPilot `.story-tab` + `.ch-tab` converted from underline to fill style. Both containers had `border-bottom` removed. Active state: `bg:var(--text-0)/color:var(--bg-0)` light, `bg:var(--blue)/color:#fff` dark. Hover state added.
- **Fix 2** (MEDIUM): TalentPilot sliders (`.pd-weight-slider`, `.cc-slider`) updated — track 4px→6px/2px→3px radius, thumb 14px→18px, box-shadow 0 1px 3px→4px.
- **Fix 3** (LOW): TalentPilot `.cc-agent-card` border-radius 12px→14px (Tier 2B feature card spec).
- **Fix 4** (LOW): TradePilot `.qr-priority-bar` height `36px` → `100%` with `min-height:36px` (adopted TalentPilot's superior approach per spec).
- **Fix 5** (LOW): Added `.d7{animation-delay:.4s}` stagger class to TalentPilot.
- **Fix 6** (LOW): TalentPilot mobile hero headline `22px` → `24px` to match TradePilot.

Files modified: `talentpilot/index.html`, `tradepilot/index.html`. Both apps load, theme toggle works, all views render.

## 2026-03-08 — Cody (Session 6)

Implemented `specs/positioning-messaging-overhaul.md` (commit `a7dbe00`). All 13 changes deployed to pilot-suite-sigma.vercel.app.

**Title/identity:** "AI Product Builder" → "AI Product Strategist" everywhere: page title, meta/og tags, hero status line, footer.

**Hero:** Headline replaced with single-idea value prop ("I help enterprises validate AI product bets / before they commit the engineering budget."). Two body paragraphs → one tight paragraph. Stats row removed ("10+, 2, 5+, 1" undercut confidence).

**Story:** Entire chapter-cards + Prototype-First Discovery methodology (~40% of page) replaced with 3-row timeline: year | colored label | one-liner. Mobile stacks single-column.

**Work section:** Architecture Pillars banner removed (redundant with Thesis). Coming soon cards (HealthPilot, AutoPilot) hidden from Work listing page — still present in Thesis domain table as "(next)". Tags: TradePilot → Decision Queue / Glass Box / 10-80-10 Workflow; TalentPilot → Decision Queue / Glass Box / Bias Monitoring.

**Thesis:** 3 paragraphs → 2. CTA "Start a conversation" → "Book a 30-minute demo".

**Contact:** "Let's find your domain" → "Let's talk about your AI product bet." Body updated to speak directly to target buyer (VP/Director with AI budget).

No design system changes. Dark mode, light mode, and mobile all verified.

## 2026-03-08 — Cody (Session 7)

Implemented `specs/bio-timeline-corrections.md` (commit `d062914`). Three text-only corrections to `index.html`:

- Timeline Enterprise: `2015–2024` → `2016–now`
- Timeline Education: `2023–2025` → `2023–2026`, added `(expected 2026)` to text
- Hero paragraph: "A degree in Human-Centered AI taught me" → "Studying Human-Centered AI at Texas Tech taught me"
- Chapters data: updated degree reference to in-progress ("are giving me the frameworks", added `(expected 2026)`)
- Meta description already accurate — no change needed

No layout changes. All 7 acceptance criteria verified.

## 2026-03-08 — Cody (Session 8)

Implemented `specs/remove-about-me-add-back-nav-suppress-tour.md` (commit `2223fb6`). Changes across both prototype apps:

**TradePilot:** Removed About nav section (About label + About Me nav item). Moved collapse-toggle to System nav section. Added `← Portfolio` link at top of sidebar (uses `nav-item` class + `nav-text` span so it collapses correctly). Added `if (window.self !== window.top) return;` at top of `initTour()`. Added `tourLaunchBtn` display:none in iframe context after DOMContentLoaded.

**TalentPilot:** Removed About Me nav item and "About" label (Product Story + collapse-toggle kept). Deleted entire `view-builder` div and orphaned content (~115 lines). Removed `builder: 'About Me'` from breadcrumb names. Same iframe tour suppression pattern as TradePilot.

Both apps verified: ← Portfolio link visible in sidebar, no About Me, tour launches on direct visit, Product Story kept in TalentPilot.
